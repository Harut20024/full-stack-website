1. Copy the .env.example file into a file called .env and update the values as needed.

2. Install dependencies:

## if it dont work do this steps

1.Clear npm cache and reinstall dependencies: Sometimes, corrupted cached files can lead to issues. Try clearing the npm cache and then reinstalling the dependencies by running the following commands in your project directory:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```
2.Delete node_modules and package-lock.json: If the above step doesn't work, you can try deleting the node_modules directory and the package-lock.json file, and then reinstalling the dependencies:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```
3.Reinstall bcrypt: If none of the above steps work, you can try uninstalling bcrypt completely and then installing it again:
```bash
npm uninstall bcrypt
npm install bcrypt
```
4.Check Node.js version: The error message indicates that you're using Node.js version "v20.5.1," which seems unusual as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. Make sure that you are using a supported and stable version of Node.js. You can check the Node.js website for the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version and use that.
